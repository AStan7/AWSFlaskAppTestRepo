                <u><h2>About Home Dermatologist</h2></u>
                <p>
                    Home Dermatologist was created to offer an accurate skin cancer screening
                    technology to try and improve the accuracy of home skin cancer self-assessments 
                    and the probability of a user staying motivated to continue testing over time.
                    To achieve this, we use Artificial Intelligence to predict the most likely
                    diagnoses of what the lesion is.  The accuracy of the model is 92% and may 
                    increase over time as more data is collected and used in the training dataset.
                    Although Home Dermatologist is proven to be accurate, it is important that HD 
                    is not seen as a replacement for a professional Dermatologist. If you have any
